My name is Adrian Carrillo and I work in the IT industry as a network administrator and Developer in the Network Operations Office at Fort Liberty, NC. I have 10 years of experience in the networking, systems administration, server administration, Linux, Windows, Virtualization, and encryption domains. If you have any further questions feel free to reach out to me!



### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
